### 7. Send/share your github repository
>   - If your project created any code in github, check your code into github, enter the link to your github repository into [blackboard](https://tamu.blackboard.com/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_6755619_1&course_id=_166985_1&group_id=&mode=cpview), and make sure that your instructor and TA  can access it (try to access the link in "incognito" mode and make sure that it works)

## COVID Mapping Project
### 1. Project Participation
> Anyone who wishes to contribute to our COVID-19 mapping efforts instead of undertaking/continuing the project they had initially proposed is welcome to do so.

> To do this, simply start entering data at the [COVID-19 County Data Site](https://covid.geoservices.tamu.edu/resources/profile). We will know that you are participating based on the email you sign up with.


### 2. Project Workload
> You should expect to enter data for at least 8 hours (one day). Some counties are hard and take a long time, some are easy and take no time at all. So, it is not possible for us to say you need to complete XYZ number of counties. Instead, we ask that you use the honor system and enter as much data as you can for at least one day.

> We would love for people to do more, but this is not required.

### 3. Project Report
> If you have decided to bail on your project, and you wish to participate our COVID-19 mapping efforts, you will not need to submit a video/presentation.
> 
> Instead, we will have a group meeting during class time on Tuesday, April 28 1:50 PM - 2:40 PM. 
>
> At this time, we will discuss the project, which will serve as your final project video/demo.

### 4. Additional Info
> You can view the [COVID-19 Lab](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-678-WebGIS/Content/blob/master/labs/11.md) for info on how and what to collect.
