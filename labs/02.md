# What is ArcGIS Online?
**ArcGIS Online** is an online, collaborative web GIS that allows you to use, create, and share maps, scenes, apps, layers, analytics, and data. You get access to **Living Atlas of the World**, apps, and ESRI's secure cloud, where you can add items and publish web layers.

# What is Collector for ArcGIS?
Collector for ArcGIS allows you to do many things including collecting and updating data in the field, whether you're online or offline. Collector works on Windows, Android, and iOS and supports external receivers for improved spatial accuracy.

# Task 1: ArcGIS Online Web Mapping

- Add layers to a map
- Add data stored in a spreadsheet or other data file to a map
- Change map symbols
- Configure pop-ups
- Share the map as a web app
