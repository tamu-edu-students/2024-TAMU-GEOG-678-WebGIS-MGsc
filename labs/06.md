# What is GEOJSON?
GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. <br />
The features include points (therefore addresses and locations), line strings (therefore streets, highways and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types.
```javascript
//GeoJSON Example
var geojsonFeature = {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Coors Field",
        "amenity": "Baseball Stadium",
        "popupContent": "This is where the Rockies play!"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-104.99404, 39.75621]
    }
};
```



# Task:
### Preparing your page <br  />
Before writing any code for the map, you need to do the following preparation steps on your page:
- Create a new html file with basic components
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>add a title</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
- Include Leaflet CSS file in the head section of your document:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.3.1/dist/leaflet.css"
   integrity="sha512-Rksm5RenBEKSKFjgI3a41vrjkw4EVPlJ3+OiI65vTjIdo9brlAacEuKOiQ5OFh7cOI1bkDwLqdLw3Zg0cRJAAQ=="
   crossorigin=""/>
```
- Include Leaflet JavaScript file after Leaflet’s CSS:
```html
 <!-- Make sure you put this AFTER Leaflet's CSS -->
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.3.1/dist/leaflet.js"
   integrity="sha512-/Nsx9X4HebavoBvEBuyp3I7od5tA0UzAxs+j83KgC8PU0kgB4XiK4Lfe4y4cgBtaRJQEIFCW+oC506aPT2L1zw=="
   crossorigin=""></script>
```
- Put a div element with a certain id where you want your map to be:
```html
 <div id="mapid"></div>
```
- Make sure the map container has a defined height, for example by setting it in CSS:
```html
#mapid {
    height: 600px;
    width: 800px;
  }
```

### Setting up the map <br  />
Let’s create a map of the center of London with pretty Mapbox Streets tiles. First we’ll initialize the map and set its view to our chosen geographical coordinates and a zoom level:

```html
var map = L.map('mapid').setView([39.74739, -106], 4);
```

Next we’ll add a tile layer to add to our map, in this case it’s a Mapbox Streets tile layer. Creating a tile layer usually involves setting the URL template for the tile images, the attribution text and the maximum zoom level of the layer. In this example we’ll use the mapbox.streets tiles from Mapbox’s “Classic maps” (in order to use tiles from Mapbox, you must also [request an access token](https://www.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/)).

```html
L.tileLayer('https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?access_token={accessToken}', {
    attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, Imagery © <a href="http://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>',
    maxZoom: 18,
    id: 'mapbox.streets',
    accessToken: 'your.mapbox.access.token'
}).addTo(map);
```

### Adding GeoJSON Features (Point/Line/Polygon) into Your Map <br  />
Leaflet supports all of the GeoJSON types above, but [Features](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-objects) and [FeatureCollections](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects) work best as they allow you to describe features with a set of properties. 
- Point
```javascript
var myPoint = {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Coors Field",
        "amenity": "Baseball Stadium",
        "popupContent": "This is where the Rockies play!"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-104.99404, 39.75621]
    }
};
```
- Line
```javascript
var myLines = [{
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[-100, 40], [-105, 45], [-110, 55]]
}, {
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[-105, 40], [-110, 45], [-115, 55]]
}];
```
- Polygon

```javascript
var myPolys = [{
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {"party": "Republican"},
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[
            [-104.05, 48.99],
            [-97.22,  48.98],
            [-96.58,  45.94],
            [-104.03, 45.94],
            [-104.05, 48.99]
        ]]
    }
}, {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {"party": "Democrat"},
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[
            [-109.05, 41.00],
            [-102.06, 40.99],
            [-102.03, 36.99],
            [-109.04, 36.99],
            [-109.05, 41.00]
        ]]
    }
}];

```
GeoJSON objects are added to the map through a GeoJSON layer. To create it and add it to a map, we can use the following code:
```javascript
L.geoJSON(myPoint).addTo(map);
L.geoJSON(myLines).addTo(map);
L.geoJSON(myPolys).addTo(map);
```
### Styling Your Feature<br  />
The *style* option can be used to style features two different ways. First, we can pass a simple object that styles all paths (polylines and polygons) the same way:
```javascript
var myStyle = {
    "color": "#ff7800",
    "weight": 5,
    "opacity": 0.65
};
L.geoJSON(myLines, {
    style: myStyle
}).addTo(map);
```
Alternatively, we can pass a function that styles individual features based on their properties. In the example below we check the "party" property and style our polygons accordingly:
```javascript
L.geoJSON(myPolys, {
    style: function(feature) {
        switch (feature.properties.party) {
            case 'Republican': return {color: "#ff0000"};
            case 'Democrat':   return {color: "#0000ff"};
        }
    }
}).addTo(map);
```

### Adding External GeoJSON File<br  />
Let’s display our [states data](http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/us-states.js) on a map using external GeoJSON File. *Please delete your previous GeoJSON code*
- Step 1: Link your webpage with the external GeoJSON data; Include this code snippet after your map \<div>:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/us-states.js"></script>
```
- Step 2: Add GeoJson File into Your Map
```javascript
L.geoJson(statesData).addTo(map);
```
Alternatively, we can directly copy the external GeoJson code, and save it inside of your html file. 



### Adding Interaction <br  />

Let’s define a click listener that zooms to the state:
```javascript
function zoomToFeature(e) {
    map.fitBounds(e.target.getBounds());
}  
```


**onEachFeature** The onEachFeature option is a function that gets called on each feature before adding it to a GeoJSON layer. A common reason to use this option is to attach a popup to features when they are clicked.
```javascript
function onEachFeature(feature, layer) {
    layer.on({
        click: zoomToFeature
    });
}
L.geoJSON(statesData, {
    onEachFeature: onEachFeature
}).addTo(map);
```
