# What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML describes the structure of web pages using markup
- HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
- HTML elements are represented by tags
- HTML tags label pieces of content (elements) such as **heading**, **paragraph**, **table**, and so on
- Browsers do not display the HTML tags; they use them to render the content of the page

## HTML Elements 
- Tags are the elements that create the components of a page
- Tags surrounded by angle brackets <  >
- Usually come in pairs (Example: opening tag \<h1> and closing tag \</h1>)
- Tags are not case sensitive. New standard is to use lower case

## Page Basic Components
```html

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<!-- First line of code in all of your HTML documents.
Declaration of version of HTML -->

<html> 
<!-- Container for the document-->
    <head>
      <title> Title of page </title>
    </head>

    <body> ... </body>
</html>
<!--Content of page-->
```
- The *!DOCTYPE html* declaration defines this document to be HTML5
- The *html* element is the root element of an HTML page
- The *head* element contains **meta** information about the document
- The *title* element specifies a title for the document
- The *body* element contains the visible page content

## Basic Tags
**Headings** <br />
 \<h1>…\</h1>  to \<h6>…\</h6>

**Paragraph** <br />
\<p>… \</p> 

**Link** <br />
Anchor tag \<a>…\</a>. There are 3 kinds of links: 
- Link to page in same folder
- Link to page in different folder
- Link to outside webpage on the Internet
```html
<!-- Example of Anchor Tag -->
<a href="http://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>
```


**Image Source Tag** <br />
Image source tag is a self-closing tag (no closing tag). 
```html
<!-- Example of Image Tag -->
<img src="url" alt = "description of image" />
```
There are two components of Img tag: 
- url = point to the location of your image file
- alt = describes image for screen readers <br />

**List Tag** 
- The \<ul> tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list.
- The \<ol> tag defines an ordered (numbered) list.
- Use the \<ul> / \<ol>tag together with the \<li> tag to create list items.

# What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. It is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. <br \>
CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
- Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
```html
<h1 style="color:blue;"> This is a Blue Heading</h1>
```
- Internal - by using a \<style> element in the \<head> section
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page
```html
<head>
    <style>
        h2{
           font-size: 16px;
           color:red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<!-- Basically, you can have elements on the left side and their attributes specified within the braces. -->
```   



- External - by using an external CSS file
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!
```html
<link rel=“stylesheet” type=“text/css” href=“demo.css”/>
```
