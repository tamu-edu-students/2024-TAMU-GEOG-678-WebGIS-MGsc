# Creating Story Map Journal
We start by going to the [Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) website. Click on the **Apps** button on the top or expand the hamburger menu to see the **Apps** button.

## Journals
We now must give our journal a name. This name is what is presented to the user whenever the open your story map journal. Let's call ours **Aggieland** then hit the **>** key to continue.

## Setting the main stage
Now we must provide the main section content that will be seen whenever you log on. We can choose between four different content types: a map, an image, a video, or a web page. Let's choose an image. You can use any image you want, in this case I'll be using a random photo of the water tower. After that you will be asked to provide some text to accompany the image in a header, sub-text type flow.

After you hit save you should be presented with your first section inside your journal.

## New section
Now let's add a new section that shows a map of everyone's favorite building: O&M. Go ahead and click the **ADD SECTION** button near the bottom of the side pane. Let's name our section **Eller Oceanography and Meteorology Building**. Make sure your content type is a map. Under that select the **Create a map** option. You'll be asked to name your map, I named mine **Eller Oceanography and Meteorology Building**. Hit **CREATE**. You'll now be presented with a map window.

Use this window to style your map to however you want, just make sure you zoom into the O&M building or your section will make no sense.

Let's add a marker to our map. To do this choose the **Add** button at the top. Here you can choose from many different ways to add a layer. I'm going to use a .csv so I'll select **Add Layer from File**.
>
![Add layer](../images/modules/25/addlayer.png)

Once you add the layer you will be presented with many different styling options to choose from. I'm going to leave mine on the default **Types (Unique symboles)** option. Press **SAVE**..

You can now double check the settings before you add the section in.

Press **NEXT** and you'll be given the opportunity to add header and detailed text to your section.

We can now view our journal. If you scroll down the page you'll see how it goes from the home section to our O&M section and seemlessly changes the main content along the way.
