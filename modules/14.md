## Operators
Operators in Javascript are rather self explanatory but we'll touch on them briefly. 
>
Operator | Explanation | Example
--- | --- | ---
\+ | Addition, adds variable's values | var one = 0 + 1; returns 1
\- | Subtraction, subtracts variable's values | var two = 3 - 1; returns 2
\* | Multiplication, multiplies variable's values | var three = 3 * 1; returns 3
/ | Division, divides variable's values | var four = 12 / 4; returns 4
% | Modulus, gives you the remainder of division | var five = 17 % 6; returns 5
++ | Increment, addes 1 to the variable value | var six = five++; returns 6
-- | Decrement, subtracts 1 from the variable value | var seven = 8--; returns 7
+= | Adds the next value to the first value | var a = 1; a += 2; returns 3
== | Equal in value, returns a boolean | 5 == 4; returns false
=== | Equal in value and type, returns a boolean | 5 === "5"; returns false
!= | Value not equal, returns a boolean | 10 != 1; returns true
!== | Value or type not equal, returns a boolean | 10 !== "10"; returns true
\> | Greater than, returns boolean | 4 > 2; returns true
\< | Less than, returns boolean | 4 < 20; returns true
\>= | Greater than or equal, returns boolean | 4 >= 3; returns true
\<= | Less than or equal, returns boolean | 20 <= 21; returns false
\&& | And, returns boolean. For true all expressions must return true | var x = 6; (x < 10 && x > 5) returns true
\|\| | Or, returns boolean. One of the expressions must return true | var x = 6; (x < 10 \|\| x < 5) returns true
\! | Not, returns boolean. Returns opposite of value given | var bill = true; !bill returns false
## Functions
In coding it is common and good practice to break up larger blocks of code and programs into multiple **functions** of code. A **function** is "a block of code designed to perform a particular task". You can declare (define) a function with the following:
```javascript
<!-- EXAMPLE OF JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION -->
var res = addNumbers(1, 3);

function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
```
You can *call* a function by simply writing the name and providing values for the parameters. Note how this super complicated function is denoted with the reserved keyword **function** then followed by the **function** name **addNumbers**. The two named variables inside the parenthsis are known as the **parameters**; functions can have any number of **parameters** though you don't want to include to many as it will be hard for you and anyone else to read your code. Another good piece of advice is to have parameter names that represent the values well, don't use ambiguous variable names. *EVER*. The **function** code is then housed inside the squiggly brackets. Our function is crazy simple and doesn't have much meat to it, but if you needed to process your parameters before doing anything with them you could do so here. Note the reserved keyword **return**. This makes our function **return** a value to the original caller. You can see in the example that the variable **res** calls the function **addNumbers** providing 1 and 3 as parameters. The function then takes these numbers, adds them, and then returns the result. The result is then stored the value of our variable **res**. Functions are great for creating modular code that allows the programmer to reuse portions of code elsewhere, reducing reduntant code.
```javascript
function addNums(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
function setupMap() {
    var map = L.map('map').fitWorld();

    L.tileLayer('URLTOTILESOURCE', {
        maxZoom: 18
    }).addTo(map);
}
function main() {
    var x = 1;
    var y = 2;
    console.log(addNums(x, y));

    setupMap();
}
```
## Loops
Loops are useful little statements that allow you to iterate over large amounts of data and perform some action on the data; an "easy way to do something repeatedly". Loops work by setting some block of code that will execute until some requirement is made. There are a large variety of loops that you can use, and each one has a particular use. Below you will see a variety of loops used in Javascript and when it would be best to use such a loop in your own code.
### for Loop
```javascript
<!-- EXAMPLE OF FOR LOOP -->
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // PRINTS 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    console.log(i);
}
var afcSouth = ["Texans", "Jags", "Titans", "Colts"];
afcSouth.forEach(function(element) {
    // PRINTS Texans, Jags, Titans, Colts
    console.log(element);
});
```
Above is a classic **for** loop. For loops are great for iterating through arrays or for running a command a set number of times. There are two ways to use for loops: the classic C way or with the fancy **forEach**. The C way requires three components. The first component is the local variable used by the for loop in it's termination evaluation. The second part defines when the for loop will terminate. The final part tells the for loop what it will do every time the loop completes a cycle. The code below the for delcaration is what is executed every cycle. 
>
The **forEach** way of doing for loops is easier to setup but a little more limited in what it can do. I recommend only using this when iterating over an array of values. Given an array, you can call **forEach** which will then pass every value in the array to a local function one at a time. You can then process that value. With the **forEach** there is no need to setup any termination rules: it will stop whenever it has finished the last element in the array.

### do while Loop
The do while loop is useful for iterating over a large set of data until a condition is evaluated to be false. This is useful if you're wanting to continue doing something until you receive a particular value, in which case you then terminate the do while with a false evaluation. It is important to note that with do while loops the statement will execute before the condition is checked. This means it will execute at least once.
```javascript
<!-- EXAMPLE OF DO WHILE -->
var j = 0;
do {
    // PRINTS 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    console.log(j);
    j++;
} while (j < 5)
```
>
### while loop
While loops will continually execute as long as the specificed contition is true. Unlike a do while, while loops will check the condition before they execute the code block. One must take great care when using while loops as it is easy to create infinite loops. These are while loops in which the condition is always true, so the loop can never terminate.
```javascript
var k = 0;
while(k < 5) {
    // prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    console.log(k);
    k++;
}
while(true) {
    // BAD TIMES AWAIT HERE
}
```
